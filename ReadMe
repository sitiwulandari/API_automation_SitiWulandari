Key Notes:

This automation framework uses the Rest Assured Java library to test Rest APIs.
JUnit 4 is the chosen unit testing framework.
Cucumber is used to run the framework in a behavior-driven development model.

To execute the framework, you will need the following dependencies:
Java
Maven
Rest Assured
JUnit 4
Cucumber 

The test cases are written in feature files, which describe the expected behavior of the API.
The code implementation is performed in step definition files.
The test runner is used to execute the project. It reads the feature files and step definition files, and then executes the tests.
To generate Test Reports, it requires running the project in CLI mode using 'mvn test verify' as this ensures
that all of the tests are executed and that the reports are generated correctly.

***Final Note***
Recommend reading the project goals file. It contains important information about the scope of the tests in 
this framework and other features that can make testing and debugging easier.
